Purpose of the Modals Component
The Modals component provides a reusable and customizable interface for creating modal dialogs or pop-ups.
It is designed to display content such as forms, confirmations, or additional information without navigating away from the current page.
* The Models folder inside the components folder is reserved exclusively for modal components used throughout the project.
* Do not include other types of components, such as buttons or dropdowns, in the Models folder; 
* it should only contain modal-related elements.
