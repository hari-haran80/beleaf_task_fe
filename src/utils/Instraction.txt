The utils folder is for utility functions or helper functions that provide reusable code for various parts of your application, such as date formatting, string manipulation, or data validation.

Do not place business logic or feature-specific code inside this folder; it should be reserved for generic, reusable functions that can be utilized across different components or features of the application.
